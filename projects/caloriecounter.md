summary: A web application that I had created for my final project for ICS321.
---


For the final project for ICS321 at UHM, I had created a web application that utilizes a simple database to log a person's meals as well as calculating calorie consumption based on those meals. This application was stored and hosted on a C Panel server supplied by the professor at the time. 


While the class was centered around databasing using MySQL, much web development skills were self taught, and, in that regard, this project was a demonstration of not only the databasing skills learned in class but the research skills that I had developed before and during the project. 

You can see a demonstration of the application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ley4uvlTPV8).
