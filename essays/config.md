Imagine, for a moment, you are friends with two people who had just bought a book that you had recommended to them. Imagine, as well, that you are knowledgable on this book and consider it one of your favorites. One friend has read the book and the other has only read a couple chapters. The friend who has read this book comes to you today with a question on the theme surrounding the main characters arc throughout the story as he is confused by some elements. He explains his interpretation of the writing and inquires on yours. In the end of the conversation, you have increased your friend's understanding of the material at hand.
