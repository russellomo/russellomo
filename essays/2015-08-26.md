**Learning JavaScript**

The computer science curriculum starts a student off with a popular high level language, typically on the lines of Java and Python. Then, as that student continues down this academic road, they find themselves delving into lower level languages, even to the point of using something as low as DLX, with the direct manipulation of registers and memory. 

Now after learning JavaScript and having played around with it, it certainly is a language that is very easy to pick up, especially if you have prior experience in programming. All of the fundamental programming language characteristics are here, from variable declarations, flavors of loops, and object oriented features.
