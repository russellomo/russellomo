## Overview ##

The problem: Textbooks are expensive and used textbooks at a reasonable price are hard to find. While your friends may be a good source of used books to buy from, there are around 20,000 other students who could provide some deals. 

The solution: Textbook exchange provides a means for UH Manoa students to communicate their textbooks needs, whether they are selling or buying. 

Users create profiles which show their major and courses taken. These profiles will allow users to have listings of books they are willing to sell as well as listings they may be interested in. When two users have met each others requirements, the buy can accept the listing and the user holding the listing can schedule a meet up time and location for the transaction. 

## Mockup Page Ideas ##

- A home page which shows listings and a place to login/signup
- User home page which shows account specific information (current user listings)
- A search page to search listing based on criteria such as major and classes
- a listing creation page to put up a book for sale
- Admin login and profile page, which has ability to manage the listings
- FAQ page


## Use Case Ideas ##

- New user goes to home page to sign up, taken to sign up form, creates profile, able to see profile page 
- User goes to search page, enters in seaerch criteria, gets shown search page based on that criteria
- On search results page, users can accept listings, set up meet time with other account
- After the user holding the listing has completed transaction, they can mark their listing as complete
- Admin logs into site, sees admin profile page which has access to the database, and can modify database (clear 	out old listings for example).

## Beyond the Basics ##

- Link up to class infomation sites, which show required texts. 
- Rating system for books and other users 
- Ability to add friends
- Messaging service
- Add location to search criteria
